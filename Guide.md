**Welcome to our game Beginners!**
Hello everybody that plays our game!
Some people might think that they have wasted 30 coins for nothing. But, here are our tips... and tricks
from the makers themselves!
**VERY HELPFUL TIP**
Split the money. Don't spend it all on Ammo and Guns;
Remember, there are different characters. 
Plus, when you read this, the game pauses **AUTOMATICALLY**. So, make SURE TO GRAB A **PENCIL AND PAPER SO YOU CAN WRITE SOME IMPORTANT STUFF DOWN**


*Shop Guide*
Guns:
    **Very Helpful Note for Guns/Lvls:**
    Remember, **YOU CAN ALWAYS PRESS THE RIGHT KEY AND SWITCH TO A GUN THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT**
    *#Infinite Levels 1~20*
    If I were you, since there are 20 coins in the first round, save up in the second round and the third round in a total of (20+30+80) 130 coins. With 130 coins, you can buy the MG 42, which will probably with enough luck, help you go through the first three levels, and since **The SHOP cannot be ACCESSED until LVL 3**, this will be enough to buy the MG 42. This gun will help you last the first 1~20 infinite levls (ILV). 
    *Infinite Levels 21~40*
    A simple piece of advice for these levels: *SAVE UP FOR THE SMG* because the Lazer's Ammo costs money and very likely, there is no way that you can get enough coins for the Lazer. 
    *Infinite Levels 41~80*
    Another simple piece of advice: Buy the Lazer and a lot, I mean a lot, of ammo. 
    *Infinite Levels 81+* 
    A few pieces of advice? Buy the last gun, the Ailenator and buy a lot of ammos for the gun. Plus, save enough coins for the heal items. Buy now, you should have at least a decent character/armour. 

Healing Items:
    **Very Helpful Note for Healing Items:**
    Heal Items as you might know, don't give extra health. They just heal you +*x* amount, up to 50, when you are at basic minimal health when the game starts. For lower health problems, the Cann of Hp is better than the Bucket of Hp. But the Med-Pack is better than the Cann of Hp, although wasting money on bigger Hp capsules when there is no need is a waste because it doesn't "add to future damage". That means that when you use an item, and say you are at 30 health, and buy the Bucket of Hp, and you have 50 maximum Hp, doesn't mean that the ten leftover counts for the future damage. So, make sure not to **WASTE MONEY**

Armour: 
    **Very Helpful Note for Armour:**
    Armour, although it might not seem like it, is/can be worth more than the new player bases, or skins. With the bases, the *LINE* at the very end on your left side changes colour, as well as the player skins. But, armour can give you extra health. When armour is bought, the player's hp doesn't go down. Rather, the armour's extra hp goes down until there is nothing left, then the player's hp starts to go down. 

Base: 
    **Extremely Helpful Note for Base:**
    Bases, as I (@dambbu) explained up above, give new player skins, HP, and in some cases, special perks. Some might give you a lot of speed, but reduced HP. Skins/Bases like Ninja, Kamakazier, and the Viking gives you (especially Ninja) HP, but gives you extreme crazy speed. So, decide which one you want and consider the cost, speed, and HP.  

Zombies: 
    **Very Very Helpful Note for Zombies MUST READ:**
    Zombies are one of the keys to this game. Understanding them, and how many come per level is extremely critical. For example, the Type Extremely Heavy Boss 1 comes at per 20 levels. It also has loads and loads of Hp (800, to be exact), but it is slow. It also does 180 damage, the most damage a zombie can do per life. Of course, **ZOMBIE HP = ZOMBIE DAMAGE**. There is also a pattern that you will be able to see **IF YOU SCROLL DOWN** that I have written, as well as Gun Costs, Healing Items, Armour, Bases, etc, etc.
